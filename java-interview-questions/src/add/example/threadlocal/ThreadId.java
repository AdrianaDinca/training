/*
What is the ThreadLocal class? How and why would you use it?

A single ThreadLocal instance can store different values for each thread independently.
Each thread that accesses the get() or set() method of a ThreadLocal instance is accessing its own, independently initialized copy of the variable.
ThreadLocal instances are typically private static fields in classes that wish to associate state with a thread (e.g., a user ID or transaction ID).
The example below, from the ThreadLocal Javadoc, generates unique identifiers local to each thread.
A threadâ€™s id is assigned the first time it invokes ThreadId.get() and remains unchanged on subsequent calls.

    // Next thread ID to be assigned

    // Thread local variable containing each thread's ID
    private static final ThreadLocal<Integer> threadId =
            new ThreadLocal<Integer>() {
                @Override protected Integer initialValue() {
                    return nextId.getAndIncrement();
                }

            };

    // Returns the current thread's unique ID, assigning it if necessary

        return threadId.get();
    }

        threadId.set(i);
